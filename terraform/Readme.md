<!-- ECS Task Definition and Service:
In the Terraform script, we defined an ECS task definition that specifies the container image URL (pointing to the ECR repository). This task definition is then associated with an ECS service.

ECS Service Desired Count:
The ECS service configuration in Terraform includes a desired_count parameter (set to 1 in our example). This means ECS will try to maintain one running instance of the task at all times.

Automatic Image Pulling by ECS:
When you create an ECS service and specify a desired count, ECS attempts to pull the specified image and run the task. If the image isn’t available when the ECS service is first created (like before you’ve pushed it to ECR), the ECS service will retry pulling the image from ECR until it’s available. 
 
Therefore, as soon as you push the image to ECR, ECS detects the image is ready and then automatically pulls and starts the container based on the task definition settings.-->
